# What We Are Building
Hello and welcome to the course! ðŸ‘‹

In this course, weâ€™re going to build a Trello-style task board. This will give you the opportunity to:

* develop a drag-and-drop interface with Vue.js
* style an application with Tailwind CSS
* enhance an application with VueUse
* and build a simple yet robust real-world interface
